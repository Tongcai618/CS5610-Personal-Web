## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a personal homepage using **vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ modules**.  
The page introduces myself, highlights selected projects, and provides contact information.  
It also demonstrates good coding practices, accessibility, responsive design, and includes a creative “honeycomb gallery” component that differentiates it from other homepages.

## GenAI

Use of GenAI

I used OpenAI GPT-5 (September 2025 version) as a writing assistant while preparing this project. Specifically:

Improving README clarity: I drafted the README myself, and then used ChatGPT to help rephrase some sentences so they were more concise, professional, and easier to understand.
